** What's here

- *bin* - my python and non-python scripts (right now empty-ish)
- *.config*
  - *fish* - the fish shell

- *Library/Application Support/Alfred* - Alfred 5
- *wallpapers* - self-explanatory. Here because OS needs it locally

** What's not here
- emacs preferences is a [[https://github.com/ay4/ayemacs][separate repo]].
